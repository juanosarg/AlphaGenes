		<description>Rox-touched are a xenotype of bovine-like humans, standing out by their tall, robust frames covered in velvety, thick fur, which comes in a wide array of colors and patterns. Their faces feature endearing, expressive eyes that exude warmth and curiosity, framed by a pair of gracefully curved, crescent-shaped horns. Rox-touched almost universally consider themselves to be the divine progeny of a godlike mythological figure known to their culture as the "All-Knowing Rox".</description>
		<descriptionShort>The Rox-touched are bovine-like xenohumans with a mystical disposition, celebrated for their gentle demeanour, close-knit communities, and exquisite culinary traditions.</descriptionShort>
